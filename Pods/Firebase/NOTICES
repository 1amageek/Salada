sqlite3
2001 September 15

The author disclaims copyright to this source code.  In place of
a legal notice, here is a blessing:

 May you do good and not evil.
 May you find forgiveness for yourself and forgive others.
 May you share freely, never taking more than you give.


This header file defines the interface that the SQLite library
presents to client programs.  If a C-function, structure, datatype,
or constant definition does not appear in this file, then it is
not a published API of SQLite, is subject to change without
notice, and should not be referenced by programs that use SQLite.

Some of the definitions that are in this file are marked as
"experimental".  Experimental interfaces are normally new
features recently added to SQLite.  We do not anticipate changes
to experimental interfaces but reserve the right to make minor changes
if experience from use "in the wild" suggest such changes are prudent.

The official C-language API documentation for SQLite is derived
from comments in this file.  This file is the authoritative source
on how SQLite interfaces are suppose to operate.

The name of this file under configuration management is "sqlite.h.in".
The makefile makes some minor changes to this file (such as inserting
the version number) and changes its name to "sqlite3.h" as
part of the build process.
